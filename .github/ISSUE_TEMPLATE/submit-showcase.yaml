        Thank you for submitting your project to our showcase!

        To be accepted, projects must:
        * Use React Flow or Svelte Flow
        * Have a screenshot available
        * Are live projects available for use (can be behind a paywall)

        We _especially_ like projects that
        * Are open source
        * Have a live usable demo
        * Use xyflow in a unique way
        * Projects with some longevity (rather than 2-week side-projects)
        * Feel different than existing showcases

        _By submitting an issue here, it is not guaranteed that we will add your project to the showcase._
        Accepted showcases will appear on https://reactflow.dev/showcase/ or https://svelteflow.dev/showcase
